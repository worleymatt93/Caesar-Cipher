# Caesar-Cipher

This is a Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts letters of the alphabet by a specified number. You can use this program to encode or decode messages using a shift key.

#Features

- Encode: Encrypt a message by shifting the letters in the alhpabet by a specified amount.
- Decode: Decrypt an encrypted message using the same shift key.
- Flexible Shift: Specify the number of positions to shift the letters in the alphabet.
- Character Handling: Non-alphabetic characters are preserved and left unchanged.
